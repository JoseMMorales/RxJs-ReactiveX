[RxJs](https://rxjs.dev/guide/overview) is a library for managing asynchronous ans event-based programs by using observables sequences. [ReactiveX](https://reactivex.io/) combines the Observer pattern with the iterator pattern and functional programming with collections to fill the need for an ideal way of managing sequences of events.

### The essential concepts in RxJS which solve async event management are:

* <b>Observable:</b> represents the idea of an invokable collection of future values or events.
* <b>Observer:</b> is a collection of callbacks that knows how to listen to values delivered by the Observable.
* <b>Subscription:</b> represents the execution of an Observable, is primarily useful for cancelling the execution.
* <b>Operators:</b> are pure functions that enable a functional programming style of dealing with collections with operations like map, filter, concat, reduce, etc.
* <b>Subject:</b> is equivalent to an EventEmitter, and the only way of multicasting a value or event to multiple Observers.
* <b>Schedulers:</b> are centralized dispatchers to control concurrency, allowing us to coordinate when computation happens on e.g. setTimeout or requestAnimationFrame or others.
